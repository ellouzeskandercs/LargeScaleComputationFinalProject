# Presentation :
The aim of this project is to parallelize the K-means algorithm using the MPI library and to study the performances of this parallelization.

# Files:
The project consists of 4 code files which are :
	- ProjectS.c : The classical Serial Program
	- Project.c : The first Parallel program
	- Project2.c : The modified version of the parallel program (2 recursive doubling merged)
	- Project3.c : Another modified version of the parallel program (Global centroids are computed only in one iteration out of two)
	
The "Report and slides" directory contains the final report in pdf version and the slides of the project presentation
